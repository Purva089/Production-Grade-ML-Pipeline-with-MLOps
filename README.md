# Production-Grade ML Pipeline with MLOps

## Overview
This project demonstrates a robust, scalable, end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed for production-grade deployment. It showcases best practices in MLOps, including automated data workflows, model training, versioning, and continuous deployment using modern tools and containerization.

## Features
- **Automated ETL workflow** to clean, transform, and prepare data for modeling.
- **Experiment tracking** with MLflow and pipeline orchestration using ZenML.
- **Model training and validation** using industry-standard frameworks like TensorFlow.
- **Containerized deployments** with Docker to ensure consistent environments.
- **Deployment pipeline support** via CI/CD, enabling seamless production rollouts.
- **REST API endpoint** for serving model predictions in real-time.

## Tech Stack
Python, MLflow, ZenML, TensorFlow, Docker, CI/CD tools, REST APIs  

### Prerequisites
Youâ€™ll need:
- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- A supported CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
